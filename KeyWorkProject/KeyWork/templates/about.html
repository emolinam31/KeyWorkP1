                        KeyWork is a service designed to address the needs of operational employers who manage large volumes of physical resumes that are often lost or mishandled during the application process, as well as individuals who need to create or digitize their resumes. KeyWork is a web application that streamlines the digitization of physical resumes through designated collection points, where applicants can drop off their printed CVs to be scanned and converted into digital formats. Additionally, the platform offers an innovative parallel solution: generating structured digital resumes via short interviews conducted directly at these collection points. Unlike traditional methods or competing services, KeyWork seamlessly integrates physical and digital resume management, featuring voice input capabilities for effortless digital conversion, ensuring that no CV is overlooked.
                        Develop an efficient solution to digitize physical resumes through accessible collection points and a tool that enables the creation of digital resumes via recordings that can be uploaded. Our goal is to optimize operational talent management, ensuring no profile is lost and enhancing the experience for both candidates and companies.
